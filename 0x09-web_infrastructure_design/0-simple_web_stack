Everything runs on a single server with IP address: 8.8.8.8

----------------------------------------
Components Explained:

- Server:
  A physical or virtual machine that hosts the website's software stack.

- Domain Name:
  'foobar.com' maps to the server's IP address, making it easier for users to access.

- DNS Record:
  The 'www' in 'www.foobar.com' is a subdomain. It typically uses an A record to point to 8.8.8.8.

- Web Server (Nginx):
  Handles incoming HTTP(S) requests, serves static files, and forwards dynamic requests to the app server.

- Application Server:
  Runs the backend application logic (e.g. Python, PHP, etc.), processes requests, and sends results to the web server.

- Database (MySQL):
  Stores all data such as user info, posts, transactions, etc.

- Communication:
  Users connect via HTTP or HTTPS to 8.8.8.8 using their browser. Nginx processes the request, app server handles business logic, DB returns data.

----------------------------------------
Limitations of This Setup:

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
   If the one server goes down, the whole site is unavailable.

2. Downtime During Maintenance:
   Updating code or restarting the web server causes temporary downtime.

3. No Scalability:
   One server has limited resources and cannot handle large traffic spikes.
